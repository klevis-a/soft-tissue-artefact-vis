            <b>Introduction</b>
            <br/>
            The purpose of this application is to enable visualization of the soft tissue artefact (STA) of the humerus
            and scapula. The position and orientation of the humerus and scapula were recorded via biplane fluoroscopy
            (~1 mm and ~1 deg accuracy). The skin marker positions were recorded using a 10-camera Vicon system.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Animation Control</b>
            <br/>
            The play/pause button and slider bar at the bottom of the page provide control of the animation. The frame
            number shown to the right of the slider bar corresponds to the bi-plane fluoroscopy frame number.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Marker Set</b>
            <br/>
            The scapula marker cluster is comprised of 4 markers attached to key landmarks on the scapula. The humerus
            marker cluster is also comprised of 4 markers. These markers are affixed on a rigid plate, which is attached
            to the humerus using an arm band. For the humerus and scapula marker clusters, each marker is assigned a color
            (red, green, blue or yellow) and its position is computed using two methods. In the first method
            (represented by a solid marker) the marker position is derived directly from the Vicon system. In the second
            method (represented by a mesh marker) the marker position is computed by rigidly attaching the marker to its
            corresponding segment (humerus or scapula) in the first frame. Therefore, the mesh marker represents the
            marker position without STA. Grey markers represent markers attached to the torso, forearm, or
            hand of the subject. The forearm and hand markers are not shown by default. The humerus also has a fifth
            marker attached to the lateral epicondyle, however this marker is not considered as
            part of the humerus marker cluster (so it's shown in grey).
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Visualization Aids</b>
            <br/>
            The markers within a marker cluster are connected together via solid lines. This aids in visualizing how the
            entire marker cluster is deforming. In addition, solid and dashed lines - corresponding to solid and mesh
            markers, respectively - trace the path of each marker throughout the animation.
        </p>

            <b>Configuration Parameters</b>
            <br/>
            In the upper-right hand corner of the application a set of configuration parameters is available. In the
            first set of configuration parameters (arrived at by selecting the first Open Controls) the marker, trace,
            and marker cluster visibility can be controlled. The second set of configuration parameters (arrived at by
            selecting the second Open Controls) provides controls over the lights in the scene.

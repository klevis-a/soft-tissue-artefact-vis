This repository contains code that creates an animated and interactive Javascript application for visualizing soft tissue artefact. It is built on top of [three.js](https://threejs.org/), a Javascript 3D library. Currently it is a work in progress. I wanted to put together a demonstration for my Ph.D. committee to determine if this concept could serve as one of my Ph.D. aims. Fortunately, it can!

This is a list of items that need to be completed before this code is available for public release:

* Account for periods of time when markers are missing due to occlusions.
* Determine how to create an "installation" procedure, mainly how to easily obtain external dependencies (such as three.js).
* Comments!
* Refactor user interface to conform to associated manuscript.
* Application should allow user to navigate the library of trials that were tracked via biplane fluoroscopy and skin markers.
* Add license.
